# Overview

This is a repository to store what I'm hoping will become a 'quick reference' for various types of microcontrollers and their capabilities. It uses Lapis as a simple web framework with Bootstrap for nicer UI elements.

Right now there's not much but playing around with Lapis, but I'm hoping to have a few pages for:

* A main page to explain the site's purpose and present buttons for a handful of common classes of microcontroller. A search bar would be nice (much) later.

* A 'microcontroller list' page to list various types of microcontrollers within a class. Show some basic information about chips as the user selects them, along with a button to go to a page with more complete info.

* A 'microcontroller information' page to show detailed information about microcontrollers and their peripherals. Eventually, it'd be nice to include example code, register information, all that jazz.

And that's about it. Pretty simple, but it'll be tough to get right. There's a lot of information to present in a fairly small area.
